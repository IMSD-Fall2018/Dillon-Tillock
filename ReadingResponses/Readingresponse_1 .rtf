\f0\fs24 \cf0 	Playing The Founder has shown me a different gaming experience. It is a a game where you are the founder or boss of a startup tech company. Their game gives you the option to specify in either the hardware side of technology development or the information side. Playing this game for several hours because it is addictive, I learned no matter which side you choose you will later be given the choice to expand and have both hardware and information focus . In the founder there are two paths to go down you either Build a create company and keep the big bucks coming in or you go negative and your bosses end up firing you, which is the only way the game ends. This game is very tactical because you have to be very wise about how you spend your money, also the calendar never stops so how quick you can make money, products and build popularity is important. Overall I feel like this game gives the user a taste into how running a business is like.}
