  My project proposal is to use the Nba's API to pull data on specifc players, representing their stats with different
objects inside of unity. I would like to incorperate a varitey of known nba players and maybe some historical players. 
Right now my idea is to have a player called based on the buttons pressed on the keyboard, each player will have 
different stat numbers hopefully outputting a different amount of objects. I need to create a controller script 
that holds the API and all the diiferent players, as well as cchoose what type of objects should represent a specific that.
I know how to create sprites for a visual representation of the player as well as spawning a game object a specific amount 
of times, I also have an understanding of how I needto pull the data from the api to the script, but to spefifcilly connect
them with the sprites and spawn objects im not to certain about. I might also need help figuring out how to initally use the 
Api that i found for the website(https://stats.nba.com/stats/playerprofile) because I need a "League ID & Player Id" ive been 
searching how to find those and still no results. This is what shows up in the browser when I input the API 
" LeagueID is required; PlayerID is required; Season is required; SeasonType is required; The GraphStartSeason property is 
required.; The GraphEndSeason property is required.; The GraphStat property is required."
